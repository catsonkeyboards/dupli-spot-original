Dupli-Spot is a web application created to manage duplicate tracks between different playlists in your Spotify library, built with the help of ChatGPT and Google, allows you to detect and remove duplicate (matching) tracks between different Spotify playlists. ðŸŽ‰

## How It Works

1. **Login with Spotify:** Click on the "Log in with Spotify" button to authenticate with your Spotify account. This will allow the app to access and edit your playlists. | <i>We do not modify your library without your full permission and action through the web app. Note you can only modify playlists that you've created and you fully own.</i>

2. **Select Playlists:** After logging in, you will see a list of your playlists. Choose two playlists from the list to compare. You can only select two playlists. You can load more playlists at the bottom of the screen. You can search for a playlist in your library, <i>the search feature is now only limited to the playists that are shown on screen to avoid loading libraries with too many playlist.</i>

3. **Show Duplicates:** Click the "Show Duplicates" button. The app will analyze the selected playlists and return a list of tracks that are present in both playlists, otherwise called 'duplicates'.

4. **Remove Duplicates:** You will have the option to remove the duplicate tracks from your selected playlist. You can select the playlist to remove the selected tracks from by selecting the playlist from the drop-down menu under the 'Remove Duplicates' button. If there are no duplicates or once all duplicates between the two lists have been removed the success message will show along with the 'Start Over' button to go back to the beginning.

Since we do not store any of your data, your Spotify Login token refreshes after every use of the application. This ensures maximum data protection. To go back to the start, you can refresh your webpage manually.

ðŸŽµ Happy playlist cleaning! ðŸŽ¶
