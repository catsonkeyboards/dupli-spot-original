Dupli-Spot is a web application created to manage duplicate tracks between different playlists in your Spotify library, built with the help of ChatGPT and Google, allows you to detect and remove duplicate (matching) tracks between different Spotify playlists. ðŸŽ‰

## How It Works

1. **Login with Spotify:** Click on the "Log in with Spotify" button to authenticate with your Spotify account. This will allow the app to access and edit your playlists. | <i>We do not modify your library without your full permission and action through the web app. Note you can only modify playlists that you've created and you fully own.</i>

2. **Select Playlists:** After logging in, you will see a list of your playlists. Choose two playlists from the list to compare. You can only select two playlists. You can load more playlists at the bottom of the screen. You can also search for a playlist that has not loaded yet in the user interface.

3. **Show Duplicates:** Click the "Show Duplicates" button. The app will analyze the selected playlists and return a list of tracks that are present in both playlists, otherwise called 'duplicates'.

4. **Remove Duplicates:** You will have the option to remove the duplicate tracks from your selected playlist. You can select the playlist to remove the selected tracks from by selecting the playlist from the drop-down menu under the 'Remove Duplicates' button. If there are no duplicates or once all duplicates between the two lists have been removed the success message will show along with the 'Start Over' button to go back to the beginning.

For data protection, the Spotify Login token refreshes after every use of the application since no user data is stored. Users can also manually refresh the webpage to start over.

Know Issues: There could be issues with handling playlists with 1000+ tracks in each playlist, please be aware that if the Web Application freezes, you can refresh and analyse playlists with fewer amount of tracks. We are working to fix the issue.

ðŸŽµ Happy playlist cleaning! ðŸŽ¶
