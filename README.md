# Dupli-Spot

Spotify Cross-Playlist De-Duplicator

ðŸŽµ My First Project! ðŸš€

This web application, built with the help of ChatGPT and google, allows you to detect and remove duplicate (matching) tracks between different Spotify playlists. ðŸŽ‰

## How It Works

1. **Login with Spotify:** Click on the "Log in with Spotify" button to authenticate with your Spotify account. This will allow the app to access and edit your playlists.

2. **Select Playlists:** After logging in, you will see a list of your playlists. Choose two playlists from the list to compare.

3. **Show Duplicates:** Click the "Show Duplicates" button. The app will analyze the selected playlists and return a list of tracks that are present in both playlists.

4. **Remove Duplicates:** You will have the option to remove the duplicate tracks from your selected playlist.

ðŸŽµ Happy playlist cleaning! ðŸŽ¶
