# Dupli-Spot

Spotify Cross-Playlist De-Duplicator

ðŸŽµ My First Project! ðŸš€

This web application, built with the help of ChatGPT and some googling, allows you to detect and remove duplicate tracks between your Spotify playlists. ðŸŽ‰

## How It Works

1. **Login with Spotify:** Click on the "Log in with Spotify" button to authenticate with your Spotify account. This will allow the app to access your playlists.
2. **Select Playlists:** After logging in, you will see a list of your playlists. Choose a minimum of two playlists from the list.
3. **Show Duplicates:** Click the "Show Duplicates" button. The app will analyze the selected playlists and return a list of tracks that are present in both playlists.
4. **Remove Duplicates:** You will have the option to remove the duplicate tracks from your selected playlist.

## Technologies Used
